Installation
============

The ``RedSpec`` package does not need to be installed, and in fact, cannot be installed. Instead, it is meant
to be ran as individual scripts. This makes it easier to work around the finicky nature of IRAF, but the package
is written this way mostly because I have not taken the time to package it properly.

The individual scripts are stored in the ``redspec`` directory of the `GitHub repository <https://github.com/gmzsebastian/redspec>`_.

PyRAF
-----

The one thing you absolutely need to do before is to install PyRAF. You can find instructions on how to do so in the
`PyRAF website <https://iraf.noirlab.edu>`_. We recommend installing PyRAF in a clean conda environment
to avoid any conflicts with other packages.
