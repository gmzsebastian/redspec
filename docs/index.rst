**RedSpec** is a set of scripts designed to reduce single slit spectroscopic data using PyRAF. The scripts
are provided on a `GitHub repository <https://github.com/gmzsebastian/redspec>`_ as opposed to an installable package.

Before using these functions you must have PyRAF installed. You can find the latest instructions on how to install
PyRAF on the `PyRAF website <https://iraf.noirlab.edu>`_. We highly recommend reading the `Before you Start <reference.html>`_ page before
starting to understand the use cases and limitations of the package.

After you have installed PyRAF and familiarized yourself with the package, you can go through each of the tutorials
to learn how to use the package and reduce your data.
